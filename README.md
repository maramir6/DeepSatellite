# DeepSatellite
DeepSatellite is a class based on Google Earth Engine API to download, manage, save and train deep learning models based on the Satellite Imagery available in the Google Earth Catalogue. Images are managed in Collections. They can be exported to Pandas Dataframe, Dictionary and Numpy Arrays. It is possible to upload them to the cloud through Firebase and Cloud SQL. Images can also be rasterized and saved both locally and in Google Storage system if the keyfile is provided. 

Scikit-Learn models such as KNN, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine are build to be easily trained and saved. Hyperparamaters optimization is supported.
